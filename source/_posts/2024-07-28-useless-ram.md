I have bought a 64Go DDR3 RAM stick for my home server.

![Image of the ram I bought](http://public.luston.fr/IMG_20240728_122243.jpg)

It was really cheap, like around 25â‚¬.

I was so exited I clicked "buy" immediately (huge modded Minecraft servers let's gooooooo). 

When it arrived, I installed it in the instant.

It didn't work.

And then it struck me.

My server can handle only 32Go... TOTAL...

Now I have a useless 64Go DDR3 RAM stick that I can't even use for my main pc (DDR4 motherboard)...
