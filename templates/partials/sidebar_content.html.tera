<h2><img width=50 src="/assets/icons/Portrait_ai2.webp" alt="Alpha core portrait"> Alpha core</h2>
from <a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/">Starsector</a> my beloved

<i><p>A rare and valuable independent AI core. This is the physical soul of an artificial intelligence, an artifact of astounding complexity capable of sophisticated thought exceeding the human mind. An object of fear, worship, and avarice; wars have been fought over the use and regulation of AI.</p>

<p>An AI core is incapable of affecting the outside world on its own. Exploitation of its vast abilities requires that the core must be submerged in a coolant bath and attached to bundles of high-capacity data lines appropriate to its tasks. When emplaced, the core is required to be fitted with an entirely analogue loyalty-assurance device; usually this takes the form of a crude chemical explosive with a mechanical trigger.</p>

<p>An alpha-level AI core is capable of excelling at any task. Assigning one to run a colony-wide industry brings benefits well beyond the capacity of human leadership, and there are even rumors of alpha cores surreptitiously assigned to govern entire worlds.</p>

<p>The alpha-level AI core is the physical soul of a fearsome alien intelligence. An alpha can create art which perfectly simulates human pathos, plausibly debate any philosophical position, and form what appear to be deep and meaningful bonds with human beings. Alphas have been known to perform elaborate 'jokes' built over years which can only be appreciated due to the intention that a particular human subject become cognitive of the whole at a specific time and context.</p>

<p>Although the locus of vast material and intellectual investment, alphas terrified Domain strategic planners. Like all AI, each alpha was watched, controlled, and ruthlessly eliminated at the first sign of disloyalty. The Hegemony carries on these policies with even greater fervor.</p></i>
